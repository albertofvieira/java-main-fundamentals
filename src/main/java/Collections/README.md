# Arrays
- Fixed in size
- Fast fro data retrievals
- Compact memory usage if size is known
- Delete operation is hard
- 2D Arrays
- Access via index

# Lists and ArrayLists
- An ordered collection aka sequence
- Allow duplicates
- Not fixed in size like Arrays
- Fast for data retrievals
- Multiple implementations: ArrayList, Stack, Vector, others...

# Stack
- LIFO - last in, first out
- Extends Vector with 5 operations
- push and pop operators
- peek method
- a method to test for whether the stack is empty

# Queue
- FIFO - first in, first out
